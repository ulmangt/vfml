VFML
====

Very Fast Machine Learning Toolkit

Based on original work by Hulten, G. and Domingos, P. "VFML -- A toolkit for mining high-speed time-changing data streams" http://www.cs.washington.edu/dm/vfml/. 2003.

Modules
====

### original
Hulten and Domingos' original VFML C code with minor modifications to support compilation on Ubuntu 10.04 and gcc 4.6.3/

### weka
Weka implementation of the VFDT and CVFDT tree-based classification algorithms. Developed mainly for educational purposes. For actual streaming classification problems, the [Moa VFDT implemention](http://moa.cms.waikato.ac.nz/) is recommended.

### data
Scripts for downloading and parsing various large datasets suitable for machine learning on massive data streams.
